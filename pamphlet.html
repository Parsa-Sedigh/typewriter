<!-- The text this effect should be short and also you need a mono space font, so the letter should be of equal sizes.
I included a font named source code pro from google font.

We use before and after pseudo elements for this and we want them to have an absolute position relative to h1 and not to the whole page,
so we gave h1 selector a position of relative.

We want to start by having a full width of ::before (so it has full width of it's container) and then slowly disappaers, so slowly, it reaveals the
characters that are underneath it.

Now create a @keyframe and name it typewriter and inside it's to {} , when we say left: 100%; it means that we want the ::before pseudo element which
currently is at the left side of it's container, to ultimately go to the RIGHT side, so important: left: 100%; means to have a DISTANCE of 100% from left side.
So inside @keyframe, to {left: 100%;} means we want it to move 100% AWAY from where it was.

So now we can see as the animation is happening, it reaveals the content behind it(currently we give ::before a background color, so we can't see
it's underneath content from start, but as the animation goes on, we can see them slowly).

Currently, we're using `ease` in animation property of h1::before and therefore, after the animation FINISHES, h1::before gonna come back to it's
starting point, but we don't want that(so after the animation finishes, it's gonna AGAIN cover the content which is underneath it), so I added a
`forwards` after `ease` and with this, once the animation runs, it(the element that has animation with `forwards` on it) doesn't go
back to it's starting position which is the left side of content, so it WON'T cover the content, so it STAYS at the end of text underneath it.

Also we didn't put a `from {}` in the @keyframes typewriter {}, so we didn't put a starting point and we only put an ending point. Now IF the starting
point is the same as whatever your initial position for that element(in this case, that element is h1::before) would be(in our case, the starting position of
h1::before is: top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;) anyway, you don't have to declare the initial property that you're animating in the @keyframes.
So in this case, we're currently changing the left property of h1::before and the initial value for this property for this element that we're animating,
is 0. Now because our initial value for left property for this element is ALSO 0, we didn't need to re-declare this left: 0; in the from {} of
@keyframes .

Now instead of using `ease` in animation property of h1::before , we use steps() . Now this is the one thing where JS maybe could do sth that we
can't do here with css and that's knowing how many characters we have in the text there. So with css, we just have to count them ourselves(including the
period and all the spaces)! and the number of these characters(again, including spaces and period) is the number we give to steps() .
So what we're saying is that: I want my typewriter animation goes from left of 0 to left of 100%(so goes 100% away from it's initial state which is left: 0;)

Now if you're wondering that experts say: NOT to do animations using positioning, like top left and right and they usually say, instead use things like:
transform(), scale() , because we don't need a buttery smooth 60fps (frames per second) animation for this. So here it's easiest way to do it.
So that's why we're doing it like this.

So here, we have 24 steps and that number depends on the characters of your text and it's revealing one letter at a time.

if you don't make the container of h1, center with display: grid; place-content: center; or with flexbox, what's gonna happen is that
the revealing animation goes from all of the WHOLE LINE and not just ACTUAL WIDTH of text. So if you don't do this, the width would stretch and
by using display: grid; and place-content: center; it causes the element to shrink it's width to it's ACTUAL CONTENT and NOT WHOLE BLOCK.
Important: Now what you can do to get this behavior by default, is that you can give the h1 a width of max-content and with this, it's gonna
 shrink and fit it's width of the content inside of it without breaking that content.

Using clamp() in font-size, the font would shrink down when the screen gets smaller. It does hit a minimum size though and on smaller screens you will
get an overflow. Why?
Because yes, the font is shrinking down, but the content won't break into multiple lines because of width set to max-content. But maybe you wonder
still the font would get smaller and it causes the element's width to shrink down, BUT the thing is that that font-size also hit a minimum size.
So for getting rid of that overflow on smaller screens, you can write a media query that turn this effect off on smaller screens OR make the text
that has this animation less(less characters).

Now let's give the background of h1::before the SAME as our text background. By doing this, it SEEMS that there isn't any letters at the beginning,
but the thing is by having the same background on h1::before, it makes the text underneath it, invisible, so it seems there isn't any letters at the
beginning. So now it's like the text is being typed, because the color which is covering it, is the SAME as the background of text.-->
